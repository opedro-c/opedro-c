### Welcome to my profile!

I'm currently working as **Software Test Engineer** and studying **Information Technology** at **Digital Metropolis Institute**; 

### Professional Background

Throughout my professional career, I have had the opportunity to work on projects of varying sizes and complexities. I have worked on projects in the fields of IoT and computer networks, both as a back-end developer and a software testing engineer, gaining exposure to microservices architecture and various interesting software tools that help make these systems work in harmony. Additionally, I worked as a full-stack web developer on a university project aimed at incubating startups, which was highly enriching in terms of handling data security requirements. Finally, I am currently working as a testing engineer again on a project that I am unable to disclose much about (due to a non-disclosure agreement), but it is focused on addressing a demand from a big tech company. In this role, I have learned a great deal about system performance and how to test it as accurately as possible to reflect real-world production scenarios.
